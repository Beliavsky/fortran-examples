* Test output: resonances_6
*   Purpose: retrieve resonance histories as trees

* Read model file

* Empty resonance history

Resonance history with 0 resonances:

Resonance tree: [empty]

* Single resonance

Resonance history with 1 resonances:
  Resonance contributors: 1 2 f(-24)

Resonance tree:
  r1: f(-24) => 1 2

* Nested resonances

Resonance history with 2 resonances:
  Resonance contributors: 1 2 f(-24)
  Resonance contributors: 1 2 3 f(23)

Resonance tree:
  r1: f(23) => r2 3
  r2: f(-24) => 1 2

* Disjunct resonances

Resonance history with 4 resonances:
  Resonance contributors: 1 3 f(24)
  Resonance contributors: 1 2 3 f(6)
  Resonance contributors: 5 7 f(-24)
  Resonance contributors: 5 6 7 f(-6)

Resonance tree:
  r1: f(6) => r3 2
  r2: f(-6) => r4 6
  r3: f(24) => 1 3
  r4: f(-24) => 5 7
