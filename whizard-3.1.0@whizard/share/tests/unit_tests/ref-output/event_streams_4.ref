* Test output: event_streams_4
*   Purpose: handle in/out switching

* Generate test process event

* Allocate raw eio stream for writing

 Event stream array:
 Raw event stream:
   Check MD5 sum     = T
   Alpha_s from file = F
   Scale from file   = F
   Events for fNLO   = F
   Writing to file   = event_streams_4.evx

* Reallocate raw eio stream for reading

 Event stream array:
 Input stream:

   Check MD5 sum     = T
   Alpha_s from file = F
   Scale from file   = F
   Events for fNLO   = F
   Reading from file = event_streams_4.evx

* Reallocate modified raw eio stream for reading (fail)
