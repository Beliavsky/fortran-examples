This directory contains Fortran 77 programs and corresponding
outputs. These are arranged in following 6 subdirectories:

sub4	Single precision (REAL*4 / COMPLEX*8) versions of 235 subprograms
	described in Appendix B

sub8	Double precision (REAL*8 / COMPLEX*16) versions of 235 subprograms
	described in Appendix B

sub16	Quadruple precision (REAL*16 / COMPLEX*32) versions of 235 subprograms
	described in Appendix B

xmp4	Single precision (REAL*4 / COMPLEX*8) versions of 126 programs
	illustrating usage of subprograms described in Appendix B.
	Sample outputs from each of these programs are also included.

xmp8	Double precision (REAL*8 / COMPLEX*16) versions of 126 programs
	illustrating usage of subprograms described in Appendix B.
	Sample outputs from each of these programs are also included.

xmp16	Quadruple precision (REAL*16 / COMPLEX*32) versions of 126 programs
	illustrating usage of subprograms described in Appendix B.
	Sample outputs from each of these programs are also included.
