/*	To calculate function value using B-spline expansion

	N : (input) Number of knots to define B-splines
	X : (input) Array of length N containing the knots.
		The knots must be distinct and in ascending order.
	K : (input) Order of B-splines, K=4 for cubic B-splines
	NDERIV : (input) Number of derivatives required
		For NDERIV<=0 only function value is calculated
		For NDERIV=1 first derivative is also calculated
		For NDERIV>1 both first and second derivatives are calculated
	WT : (input) Coefficients of B-spline expansion
	X0 : (input) The point at which expansion has to be evaluated
	DF : (output) First derivative of function at X0
	DDF : (output) Second derivative of function at X0
	IER : (output) Error parameter, IER=0 implies successful execution
		Nonzero values of IER may be set by BSPLIN which is called

	BSPEVL = SUM_{i=1}^{N+K-2} WT(I) \phi_i(X0)
	where \phi_i(x) are B-spline basis functions on knots X

	Required functions : BSPLIN
