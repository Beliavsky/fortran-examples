! This module defines a master switch for the debugging facility
!   which is implemented in diagnostics.f90.
! In all modules which use this facility, calls to debug routines should be
!   hidden behind a conditional
!      if (debug_on) ...
! The flag debug_on is defined here, and it is a parameter fixed at compile time.
! The setting is determined by configure, option --enable-fc-debug

module debug_master

  implicit none
  public

  logical, parameter :: debug_on = @FC_DEBUG_ON@
