* Test output: phs_forest_2
*   Purpose: test PHS forest routines

* Reading model file

* Create phase-space file 'phs_forest_2.phs'

* Read phase-space file 'phs_forest_2.phs'

* Extract resonance history set

Resonance history set:
 1 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   contained in (2)
 2 Resonance history with 2 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   1 2 3 f(23)
   contained in ()
 3 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 3 f(25)
   contained in ()

* Cleanup

* Test output end: phs_forest_2
