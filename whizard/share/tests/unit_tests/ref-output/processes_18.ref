* Test output: processes_18
*   Purpose: extra resonance histories

* Build and load a test library with one process

* Initialize a process library with one process

* Initialize a process object with phase space

* Extract resonance history set

Resonance history set:
 1 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   contained in ()
 2 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 3 f(23)
   contained in ()

* Cleanup

* Test output end: processes_18
