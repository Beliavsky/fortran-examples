* Test output: resonances_7
*   Purpose: test tree format

* Read model file

* Initialize, fill and freeze resonance history set

Resonance history set:
 1 Resonance history with 2 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   1 2 3 f(23)
   contained in ()
   Resonance tree:
     r1: f(23) => r2 3
     r2: f(-24) => 1 2
 2 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 3 f(23)
   contained in (1)
   Resonance tree:
     r1: f(23) => 1 2 3
 3 Resonance history with 1 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   contained in (1,4)
   Resonance tree:
     r1: f(-24) => 1 2
 4 Resonance history with 2 resonances:
   1 2 f(-24)
   1 2 3 f(25)
   contained in ()
   Resonance tree:
     r1: f(25) => r2 3
     r2: f(-24) => 1 2

* Extract tree #1

Resonance tree:
  r1: f(23) => r2 3
  r2: f(-24) => 1 2

 n_resonances = 2

 flv(r1) = f(23)
 flv(r2) = f(-24)

 [offset = 2, 4]
 children(r1) = 4 7
 children(r2) = 5 6

* Cleanup

* Test output end: resonances_7
