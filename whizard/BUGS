General:

* WHIZARD 3.0+ currently runs only with the NAGFOR 7.0 (or newer) and
  gfortran 7.5.0 (or newer) Fortran compilers as well as Intel ifort
  19.0.2 (or newer).

* WHIZARD 2.7+ incorporates all features from WHIZARD 1, making the
  legacy branch obsolete now.
  
* Please report bugs and problems or performance issues
  at our Launchpad site:
  https://launchpad.net/whizard
  or send an email to our support email address:
  <whizard@desy.de>

Known (recent) bugs:

* WHIZARD 3.0.0 and earlier might not compile together with HepMC3/ROOT
  when using a genuine C++17 standard compiler like gcc/g++ 11 and newer.
  This came from backwards compatibility with gcc/g++ 5 as a default
  C++98 compiler. Fixed in v3.0.1.

* WHIZARD 2.8.5/3.0.0beta and earlier do not support reading LCIO events
  with LCIO versions 2.15 and newer due to a bug in the LCIO interface.

* WHIZARD 2.8.4 and earlier do not support Pythia 8.301+. If you want to use
  these versions of Pythia 8 please use WHIZARD 2.8.5 or 3. Note that
  Pythia 8.301-2 and contain a bug in their LHA interface, so you have to use
  Pythia 8.303+.

* WHIZARD 2.8.3 exhibits a bug for UFO models containing Majorana fermions:
  no matrix element is generated. WHIZARD 2.8.4 solves this problem. There
  are still some wrong sign in interference terms for very complicated
  processes. They are fixed with version 3.0.0.

* WHIZARD 2.8.1 and earlier does not compile with OCaml versions 4.08.0
  and newer due to a deletion of a deprecated feature in the OCaml language.
  This is fixed in 2.8.2+ of WHIZARD. For older WHIZARD versions, please
  downgrade your OCaml version to anything between versions 4.02.x and 4.07.x.

* MPI version of WHIZARD: version 2.6.3 could produce the MPI-parallelized
  version only from the svn repository, and not from the release tarball.
  This was corrected for version 2.6.4.

* In version 2.6.0 the top threshold calculations do not work due to a
  regression. This is fixed in 2.6.1. In version 2.6.1 all processes
  with BSM resonances having PDG codes with 7 digits are broken. This is
  fixed in version 2.6.2.

Compilers and OS specialties:

* macOS Darwin >= 20.1:
  The libtool support for macOS Big Sur (darwin 20.1+) needed to be updated
  in order to treat shared libraries correctly. This affected also the
  gcc/gfortran/g++ compiler suite, so on macOS Big Sur, WHIZARD versions older
  than 3.0.0 do not work, and WHIZARD will only work with gcc/g++/gfortran
  compiler versions 8.5, 9.4, 10.3, and 11.1 or newer (in the corresponding
  sub-series).

* MAC OS X Darwin >= 10.11:
  The security measures of the new Darwin systems do not allow e.g.
  environment variables passed to subprocesses. This does not change
  anything for the installed WHIZARD, but the testsuite (make check)
  will not work before make install has been executed. make distcheck 
  will not work on El Capitan. There is also the option to disable
  the System Integrity Protocol (SIP) of modern OSX by booting in
  Recovery Mode, open a terminal and type 'csrutil disable'. However, we
  do not recommend to do so.

Manual:

* For WHIZARD 3.0, the manual is still quite sparse. We are working on
  that. Regular updates independent from the subreleases can be found
  on the Hepforge webpage:
