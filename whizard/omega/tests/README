Here's an overview of the tests of O'Mega that are performed by 'make check'

########################################################################

Essential tests:

  omega_unit

    unit tests of the O'Mega library modules

  ects (Extended Colorflow Test-Suite)

    despite the name, this just checks some very simple color
    flows against reference results in *.ects files

  cascade

    test the '-cascade' option in simple cases against reference
    results in *.cascades files
  
  phase_space

    test the '-phase_space' option used by WHIZARD's new phase
    space generator simple cases against reference results in
    *.phs files
  
  test_qed_eemm

    compare the amplitude for e+ e- -> mu+ mu- at one phase
    space point against a reference value

  compare_split_function
  compare_split_module

    check that splitting the amplitude into smaller subroutines
    or modules does not change the result

  test_omega95
  test_omega95_bispinors

    check properties of wave functions and hardcoded couplings
    form the omegalib: equations of motion, current conservation,
    etc.

  keystones_omegalib
  keystones_omegalib_bispinors

    check that splitting a vertex into a wavefunction for one
    leg and a hardcoded current for the remaining legs gives
    the same result for each leg

  keystones_UFO
  keystones_UFO_bispinors

    check that splitting a vertex into wavefunction for one leg
    and current for the remaining legs gives the same result
    for each leg.  In addition, test Fierz identities and
    different UFO expressions for the same vertex.  If available,
    also compare to the currents from omegalib.

  fermi
  fermi_UFO

    test the (anti-)symmetry of amplitudes under exchange of
    external particles

  ward
  ward_UFO

    test Ward identities for one external gauge boson

  compare_amplitude_VM

    check that the amplitudes computed by the virtual machine
    agree with the amplitudes computed by the compiled code

  compare_amplitude_UFO

    check that the amplitudes computed for a hardcoded model
    agree with the amplitudes computed for the equivalent
    UFO model


  compare_majorana_legacy

    check that amplitudes in hardcoded models computed with
    the default implementation of Fermi statistics for Dirac
    spinors agree with JRR's implementation of Fermi statistics
    for Majorana spinors

  compare_majorana

    check that amplitudes in hardcoded models computed with
    the default implementation of Fermi statistics for Dirac
    spinors agree with the new, UFO friendly, implementation
    of Fermi statistics for Majorana spinors

  compare_majorana_UFO

    check that amplitudes in UFO models computed with the
    implementation of Fermi statistics for Dirac spinors agree
    with the implementation of Fermi statistics for Majorana spinors


########################################################################

The remaining tests could be removed from TESTS:

  ufo_unit

    despite the name, this is for interactive testing and will
    not perform meaningful tests if called without arguments

  vertex_unit

    partially test an incomplete implementation of an alternative
    model file format, that is not used in production
